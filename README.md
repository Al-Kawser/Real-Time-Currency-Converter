# Real-Time-Currency-Converter
The goal of the Currency Converter project is to create a shell application that makes it simple for users to convert currency values. To give precise conversion rates, it makes use of shell scripting, functions, and external APIs or lookup tables. The application will display the converted amount once the user enters the amount, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to.
We need to follow these procedures to simulate and run this project code:
• Create a Linux environment using Fedora, Ubuntu, or CentOS.
• Make that a shell interpreter, such as Bash, is set up.
• Open a terminal in Ubuntu.
• Open a text editor (such as Gedit or Nano) with a ".sh" extension, for example, "currency-converter.sh". and write the code into this file.
• Use chmod +x to give the script permission to be executed.
• run the commands: "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt install curl jq".The sudo apt update command updates the package lists, and sudo apt install curl jq installs the curl and jq packages.
• Use./scriptname.sh to launch the script in the terminal.
• To use the system, adhere to the on-screen directions
